Hi, I'm Noah! I'm a junior at Middlebury College, majoring in American Studies. I'm also co-captain of the men's tennis team at Middlebury. I have a passion for psychology and sports psychology, and that's really what this website is focused on. On this site, my goal is to share my experiences and insights about sports psychology and performance. I hope that these experiences can help others achieve optimal performance and enjoy the experiences they will have in sport, regardless of wins and losses. As someone who plays tennis competitively, I love to learn about how to get the most out of myself, my teammates, and enjoy my sport and life to the fullest. Thanks for reading!
