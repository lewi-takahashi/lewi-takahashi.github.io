Hi, I'm Noah. I'm a junior at Middlebury College, majoring in American Studies. I have a passion for psychology and sports psychology, and that's really what this website is focused on. On this site, my goal is to share my experiences and insights about sports psychology and performance. As someone who plays tennis competitively, I love to learn about how to get the most out of myself and my teammates and enjoy my sport and life to the fullest. Thanks for reading! I hope you as much fun learning about sports psych and performance as I do.
