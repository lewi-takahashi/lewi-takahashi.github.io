Hey guys, this is my first post! Thank you for taking the time to visit this website. 
<br> In this first post, I'd like to explain the signficance behind the phrase _what is delayed is not denied_ that can be found in the footnote of each page on this site. 
<br> I was introduced to this phrase by Dawn Staley, the head coach for the South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball team. Coach Staley's list of accomplishments is impressive to say the least. After a record-setting career at Unviersity of Virginia, Staley was drafted to the WNBA. As a member of Team USA, Staley won 3 gold medals in the Olympics. As a coach, Staley has won 3 national championships at South Carolina. She's also led the Gamecocks to 7 Final Four appearances. 
<br> In a Netflix documentary called _The Playbook: A Coach's Rules for Life_, Staley details her upbringing in Philadelphia. She had to fight for a spot to play pickup basketball with her brothers and other boys who wouldn't let her play because she was a girl. "I wasn't gonna allow them to not pick me because I was a girl. I made people respect me by my persistence," she explained.
As a coach, Staley's persistence was challenged even further. Staley began her coaching career at Temple University in 2000. Staley simultaneously was playing in the WNBA, making this feat even more impressive. In 2008, Staley left Temple for South Carolina after amassing a school record of 172-80. Despite two losing seasons to start her tenure, Staley quickly made the Gamecocks contenders on the national stage. In 2014-15 season, the Gamecocks were ranked #1 in the country, but lost in the Final Four. Prior to the 2016 season, despite being one of the most decorated coaches in NCAA Division 1, Staley had yet to capture a national championship. It was during this pursuit of a national title that Staley began to say "what is delayed is not denied."
